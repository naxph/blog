First of all, I would like to thank you for actually taking your time to visit my blog in the first place. It pleases me to know that some people out there support what I do.

2021 was a mixed bag of a year for me. I finally finished my SPM examinations and got enrolled into university. Although one thing's for sure, staring at a computer screen for 8 hours a day is definitely the furthest thing from fun. Hurts my eyesight too. I had hoped to return to campus at the start of my 2nd trimester this month, but time and money constraints prevented me from doing so. Here's to staring at a computer screen for another 3 months.

Anyways, I created this blog for the purpose of documenting my journey of growing myself as a person, be it professionally or my personal life. It's also a place for me to share my opinions on topics that interest me. As for what kind of content I want to write, I honestly don't really know yet. For starters, I thought of documenting the new skills that I learn in the world of IT, and maybe a few anime reviews here and there. We'll see how it goes.

As for the technical side of things, this blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's pretty nice as Jekyll doesn't use databases or web servers and I can just focus on writing the content. There's definitely a few other things I want to work on such as creating a newsletter and maybe an RSS feed.

To conclude, I hope this blog will grow to become a place of healthy discussion and debate, a place where I can acquire varying perspectives on many different things. And may 2022 bring us bigger and better things than ever before.

Signing off,<br>
